-- | A wrapper type for @Writer@ which stores pretty-printable documents along
--   with parsed values.
--   This type is provided as standard return type for parsers.

type Parsed a = Writer [Doc] a





-- | The error type is just a synonym for @Either@ where errors are represented
--   by a pretty-printable @Doc@.

type ErrorOr a = Either Doc a



-- | A wrapper function for @runWriter@.

runChecks :: Checked a -> (a, [Doc])
runChecks = runWriter



-- | Applies a checking function (the first argument) element-wise to a list of
--   values (the second argument). The result list contains only those elements
--   for which the checking function does not yield an error.

-- | Checks if the argument contains an error.

isError :: ErrorOr a -> Bool
isError = either (const True) (const False)



-- | Returns the error message stored in the argument or @Nothing@ if there is
--   no error message in the argument.

getError :: ErrorOr a -> Maybe Doc
getError = either Just (const Nothing)



-- | If the first argument is True, then the second argument is taken as an
--   error message. Otherwise () is returned as a non-error message.

-- | Transforms a string into a pretty-printed document by splitting the string
--   into words and forming a pretty paragraph of all words.

-- | Checks a declaration for errors.
--   If the second argument is an error, this function extends the error
--   message to make clear it belongs to a declaration.
