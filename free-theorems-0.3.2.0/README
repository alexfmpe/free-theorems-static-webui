  DESCRIPTION

This library may be used to automatically generate free theorems
[1,2] from Haskell type signatures. It supports Haskell 98 and 
additionally higher-rank functions. Beside primitive Haskell types
(Int, Integer, Float, Double, Char), it already includes lists and
tuples. The library provides means to add other data types.



  DEPENDENCIES

See the file `free-theorems.cabal' for dependencies. Note that there,
two parser libraries are listed. If only one is needed, the library
is easily adjustable by commenting out the corresponding dependencies
and exported modules.


  
  INSTALL

Since this library is cabalised, it uses the standard installation
process.
  
  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install



  USAGE

See the Haddock-generated documentation for detailed information on
how to use this library.



  DOCUMENTATION

If Haddock is available, documentation may be 
generated automatically from the sources.
  
  runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
